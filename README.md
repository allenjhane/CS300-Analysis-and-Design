# CS300 - DSA: Analysis and Design

## What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
For this course, I was trying to figure out what was the best data structure to efficienlty store and search for course data.

## How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
In this course, we did assignments to understand different data structures (vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees). Through these assignments we saw how fast and slow each data structure handled the data given to it.

## How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
With any roadblocks I encountered, I would look up information based on the roadblock. This is what I did when I didn't understand a data structure and an error I got within a program.

## How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
With work on this project, it helped me understand that there are different approaches for different projects. Knowing what is the best for your application is key and there are multiple solutions to a single problem.

## How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The work on this project helped me understand how to structure code. It helped me understand that having a structure that is best for the program will not always be the same every time. Using variables while not hard coding data is the best for maintaing code with adaptable features. Comments will then help the developer understand what is going on in the future in order for code to be more readable, especially when changes need to be made for a program.
