# CS300 - DSA: Analysis and Design
 
### About the class
In this class, we learned about different data structures and how to use them efficiently in our code through projects. 

## QA based on information from projects done in the class

### What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
For this course, I was trying to figure out what was the best data structure to store and search for course data efficiently.

### How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
In order to approach this problem, I considered the different structures and what would be best to sort based on data amount. In this course, we did assignments to understand different data structures (vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees). Through these assignments, we saw how fast and slow each data structure handled the data given to it.

### How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
With any roadblocks I encountered, I would look up information based on the roadblock. This is what I did when I didn't understand a data structure and an error I got within a program.

### How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
With my work on this project, it helped me understand that there are different approaches for different projects. Knowing what is the best for your application is key and there are multiple solutions to a single problem.

### How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The work on this project helped me understand how to structure code. It helped me understand that having a structure that is best for the program will not always be the same every time. Using variables while not hard-coding data is the best for maintaining code with adaptable features. Comments will then help the developer understand what is going on in the future for code to be more readable, especially when changes need to be made to a program.
